Purpose:
Thank you for taking a look at my 4chanDataScraping script. This simple yet intuitive script was made as part of an ongoing data 
vizualization project that I am Working on. It's no secret to anyone following financial markets that most stocks tend to use 3 or 4 letter
ticker symbols. So I wanted to see what the anonymous collective on 4chan was hyping up. Using Beautiful Soup 4 this script will go into any pointed thread
(Usually reccomened the stock market general threads on 4chan's /biz/ board) and pull out the most highly occuring all capital 3 or 4 letter phrases which
correlate to stock tickers. It also counts there number of occurences.

Using the script:
The script is very plug n' play. Just download the 4chanDataScraping script and open it into your IDE of choice and run it, but before doing so, change out the thread URL to the thread that you want to pull stock data from (This can be found on line 28). 

Additionally if you just want 3 letter phrases or 4 letter phrases that can be changed on line 29 just below where you set the thread URL.
